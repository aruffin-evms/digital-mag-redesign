        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p"><span class="basic-story__lead-in">A</span>s a kid growing up in Alexandria,
          Maureen Kelleher, MS (ATC ’12), ATR, LPC,
          was always drawing in a sketchbook or paint‑
          ing with watercolors. But it wasn’t until she was
          a high school student and “stole” her brother’s
          psychology textbook to read that she considered
          a career as a therapist</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">A Psychology 101 course at Boston College
          the summer before her senior year of high
          school sealed the deal, and she went on to earn
          her undergraduate psychology degree from
          Connecticut College in 2003.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“I knew when I went to college that I wanted
          to combine psychology and art somehow,” Ms.
          Kelleher says, “but I didn’t know what art ther‑
          apy was. Art was always something I had done
          on my own. So it took me a while to find a way
          to combine the two.”</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">It was seven years later, after working with
          children on the autism spectrum and in commu‑
          nity mental health in Norfolk, that she discov‑
          ered EVMS Art Therapy and Counseling.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“This program was very rigorous,” Ms.
          Kelleher says. “But the challenges and the expec‑
          tations of excellence and the opportunities for
          internships — working with children, adoles‑
          cents and adults — were particularly helpful in
          preparing me to meet the needs of a wide range
          of patients.”</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Today Ms. Kelleher is a therapist in private
          practice in Hampton Roads. Her expertise
          encompasses trauma, anxiety, depression, grief
          and loss, self-esteem and stress management,
          and she works to empower her patients using
          the creative process of art.</p>

        <div class="basic-story__content__story">
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“Art therapy has so many applications,” she
            says. “It gives individuals the opportunity to
            express themselves in ways that can be less anx‑
            iety producing and can be helpful especially if
            somebody is having difficulty accessing words
            for what’s going on. And the creative process
            itself can boost a positive mood. That’s why art
            therapy can be so effective, and results can be
            seen so quickly.”</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">During this time of social distancing, Ms.
            Kelleher offers her therapy services through tele‑
            health. She and her patients are exploring goals
            they had prior to the outbreak of COVID‑19, as
            well as the effects of the pandemic, such as not
            seeing friends or losing work. </p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">In her spare time, Ms. Kelleher likes to ride
            horses and take her dog to the beach. She also
            reads a lot of books although, she jokes, “Not
            quite the amount required during the first semes‑
            ter of the Art Therapy program at EVMS.”</p>
