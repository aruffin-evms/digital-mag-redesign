        <h2 class="basic-story__content__description">“How can we help?”</h2>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p"><span class="basic-story__lead-in">A</span>fter COVID-19 shut down college campuses across the country in March, including EVMS, that was the first question from a group of concerned students.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“Many of us were taken off our clinical rotations and had to leave the hospitals,” says Madison Seward, MD Class of 2021, “but we still wanted to make a contribution to help those on the front&nbsp;lines.”</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">It didn’t take long to find the answer.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">As COVID-19 began spreading, it quickly became apparent that there was a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). Rising demand, panic buying and hoarding meant that PPE wasn’t available to everyone. The shortfall left doctors, nurses and other frontline workers unprepared to care for COVID-19 patients, putting them at great&nbsp;risk.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p"><a href="https://www.evms.edu/directory/profiles/alfred-z-abuhamad.php" rel=”noreferrer” target="_blank">Alfred Abuhamad, MD</a>, Vice Dean for Clinical Affairs, saw the need and
          worked
          with <a href="https://www.evms.edu/directory/profiles/joseph-l-hudgens.php" target="_blank">Joseph Hudgens, MD</a>, Associate Professor of <a href="https://www.evms.edu/obstetrics_and_gynecology/" target="_blank">Obstetrics and Gynecology</a>, to
          design two different types of face&nbsp;shields.</p>

            three dozen students made 400 face shields that were distributed at local hospitals and&nbsp;clinics.<br />

          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“We wanted to make sure healthcare workers had what they needed to treat COVID-19 patients,” says Alice Chae, MD Class of 2021. “We made a harder, plastic face shield that was reusable and then a softer, disposable&nbsp;version.”</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">They used sheets of foam cut into rectangles and pieces of elastic to make sure the shields had a good seal and felt&nbsp;comfortable.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Over four days, more than three dozen student volunteers worked in shifts to make 400 face shields, which were distributed throughout local hospitals and&nbsp;clinics.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“I’m really grateful for my fellow students who stepped up and volunteered their time to quickly construct these face shields to make sure we could get them to providers as soon as possible,” Ms. Chae says. “Their dedication and hard work made all of this&nbsp;possible.”</p>

            <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">The mask shortage also inspired a group of first-year
              medical students to get creative. Sarah Birk,
              Vivian Burton and Sam Stephenson, members of the
              MD Class of 2023, worked alongside a team of Old
              Dominion University engineers to prepare 3D-printed
              N95 masks for use at local&nbsp;hospitals.</p>
            <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“They are reusable and built like Legos,” Ms. Burton
              says. “You can take them apart, sanitize them, then
              replace the HEPA filter.”</p>
            <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">The students created several prototypes and asked
              local physicians to give their&nbsp;feedback.</p>
            <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">In all, they printed several hundred masks and
              delivered them to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital,
              Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters and&nbsp;ODU.</p>
            <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“As medical students, we really wanted to help,” Ms.
              Birk says. “Healthcare workers are doing all they
              can to protect us, and we wanted to do what we could to protect&nbsp;them.”</p>
