              CONDUCTING VITAL RESEARCH — WHILE KEEPING EVERYONE&nbsp;SAFE?</p>
            <p class="pandemic-landing__content__p">That was the question last March when the COVID-19 pandemic engulfed
              the&nbsp;nation.</p>
            <p class="pandemic-landing__content__p">Our world changed. Only a few essential personnel worked on campus.
              Research labs ramped down. Classes and patient visits moved&nbsp;online.</p>
            <p class="pandemic-landing__content__p">But that didn’t dampen the collegial and collaborative spirit EVMS is
              known for. Working together as a community — whether in real life or virtually — is in our DNA. It is, after
              all, what gave birth to EVMS more than four decades&nbsp;ago.</p>

          <div class="pandemic-landing__column pandemic-landing__column-right">
            <p class="pandemic-landing__content__p">So it was no surprise when faculty, staff, residents and students rose
              to the pandemic&nbsp;challenge.</p>
            <p class="pandemic-landing__content__p">Medical teams trained frequently with COVID-19 experts. Faculty
              members used technology in creative ways. Campus leaders met often to share news and decide on the right
              steps to take. Educators and researchers consulted with colleagues at peer schools to develop best&nbsp;practices.</p>
            <p class="pandemic-landing__content__p">And some in the EVMS community willingly risked their own health for
              the greater&nbsp;good.</p>
            <p class="pandemic-landing__content__p">Here are their stories.</p>
