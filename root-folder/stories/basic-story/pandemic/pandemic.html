                    FIRST DAY AT HIS NEW JOB. </span></p>
                    <p>As the newly appointed Vice President and
                        Chief Medical Officer for University Hospitals
                        Cleveland Medical Center, Phillip Chang, MD
                        (MD ’99), was responsible for activating and lead‑
                        ing the center’s incident response command in
                        the face of the pandemic. </p>
                      <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“Dr. Chang has been instrumental in main‑
                        taining our surge readiness through careful
                        planning and collaboration with teams through‑
                        out the system,” says Daniel Simon, MD, Chief
                        Clinical and Scientific Officer and President of
                        the UH Cleveland Medical Center</p>
                      <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">During the center’s re-opening transition,
                        Dr. Chang is leading major initiatives, includ‑
                        ing high-reliability medicine, quality and safety,
                        patient advocacy, physician relations, and uti‑
                        lization and case management for the flagship
                        academic medical center.</p>
                      <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“It’s probably the hardest but also most
                        rewarding time to start a new position,” Dr.
                        Chang says. “The work we do is vital at a time
                        when people are looking to our systems for
                        guidance and care.”</p>
                      <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Dr. Chang earned a bachelor’s degree in
                        mathematics from the College of William &
                        Mary, where he also participated in the EVMS
                        early acceptance program. His residency and
                        fellowship took him to the University of Ken‑
                        tucky HealthCare in Lexington, where he joined
                        the faculty. Over the next 13 years, he rose to
                        the rank of Associate Professor of Surgery and
                        the role of Chief of the Section of Trauma and
                        Critical Care, before being named System Chief
                        Medical Officer. </p>
                      <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Dr. Chang earned his MBA from the
                        University of Kentucky Gatton College of
                        Economics and Business in Lexington. In
                        2019, Becker’s Healthcare named him one of
                        100 CMOs to Know.</p>
                      <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">
                        He credits much of his success in medicine,
                        leadership and teaching to his time at EVMS.

                          “But my surgery elective in Dr. Britt’s trauma and
                          acute-care service was a formative experience
                          and opened my eyes to who I wanted to be as
                          a doctor.”

                          “He’s phenomenal,” Dr. Chang says. “He
                          would rapid-fire ask you questions until you sim‑
                          ply couldn’t answer anymore, and then he’d tell
                          you to go and look it up, come back and present
                          it to him. I learned so much from him.”

                          geon. His “true love” is acute-care surgery — a
                          specialty developed by Dr. Britt — and he has
                          a special interest in complex abdominal wall
                          reconstruction.

                <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Dr. Chang also models his teaching style with
                    surgery residents after his mentor.
                    “It’s hard to describe,” he says, “but it’s almost
                    magical to have that moment when you know
                    you can back off and let the residents show their
                    strengths. Making sure they are safe surgeons
                    when they finish the program has been incred‑
                    ibly rewarding.”</p>
                  <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">While he’s not currently working directly
                    with students, he says his desire to impart
                    knowledge to the next generation of health‑
                    care providers still drives him — especially in a
                    time when there is so much to learn due to the
                    COVID‑19 pandemic. </p>
                  <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“It’s a difficult time, but it is also a reward‑
                    ing time because when medical professions are
                    stressed, we see great advances,” Dr. Chang says. </p>
                  <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“Blood banks and ambulances were created out
                    of a time of war. During the COVID‑19 pan‑
                    demic, we are seeing the incredible widespread
                    adoption of telehealth and remote monitoring.
                    These extensions of healthcare are as important
                    as physicians. </p>
                  <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“It really is an amazing time to be in
                    medicine.” </p>
