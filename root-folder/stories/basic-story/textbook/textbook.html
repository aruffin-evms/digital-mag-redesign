    <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">As a kid growing up in Alexandria,
      Maureen Kelleher, MS (ATC ’12), ATR, LPC,
      was always drawing in a sketchbook or painting with watercolors. But it wasn’t until she was
      a high school student and “stole” her brother’s
      psychology textbook to read that she considered
      a career as a therapist</p>
    <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">A Psychology 101 course at Boston College
      the summer before her senior year of high
      school sealed the deal, and she went on to earn
      her undergraduate psychology degree from
      Connecticut College in 2003.</p>
    <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“I knew when I went to college that I wanted
      to combine psychology and art somehow,” Ms.
      Kelleher says, “but I didn’t know what art therapy was. Art was always something I had done
      on my own. So it took me a while to find a way
      to combine the two.”</p>
    <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">It was seven years later, after working with
      children on the autism spectrum and in community mental health in Norfolk, that she discovered EVMS Art Therapy and Counseling.</p>
    <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“This program was very rigorous,” Ms.
      Kelleher says. “But the challenges and the expectations of excellence and the opportunities for
      internships — working with children, adolescents and adults — were particularly helpful in
      preparing me to meet the needs of a wide range
      of patients.”</p>
    <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Today Ms. Kelleher is a therapist in private
      practice in Hampton Roads. Her expertise
      encompasses trauma, anxiety, depression, grief
      and loss, self-esteem and stress management,
      and she works to empower her patients using
      the creative process of art.</p>  
      <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“Art therapy has so many applications,” she
        says. “It gives individuals the opportunity to
        express themselves in ways that can be less anxiety producing and can be helpful especially if
        somebody is having difficulty accessing words
        for what’s going on. And the creative process
        itself can boost a positive mood. That’s why art
        therapy can be so effective, and results can be
        seen so quickly.”</p>
      <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">During this time of social distancing, Ms.
        Kelleher offers her therapy services through telehealth. She and her patients are exploring goals
        they had prior to the outbreak of COVID‑19, as
        well as the effects of the pandemic, such as not
        seeing friends or losing work. </p>
      <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">In her spare time, Ms. Kelleher likes to ride
        horses and take her dog to the beach. She also
        reads a lot of books although, she jokes, “Not
        quite the amount required during the first semester of the Art Therapy program at EVMS.”</p>
