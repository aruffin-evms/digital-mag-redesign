          <p class="feature__content__story__p"><span class="feature__dropcap">T</span>he five-person Distance Education
            team at EVMS had plenty to handle,
            with five online degree programs,
            four that blend online and
            in-person classes, and eight online
            certificate programs.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Then came the pandemic. And the whole
            school went online.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Fortunately, says <a
              href="https://www.evms.edu/directory/profiles/cynthia-cadieux.php" target="_blank">Cynthia Cadieux, PhD,
              RDN,</a>
            Director of Distance Education, “EVMS had a
            talent pool ready to rise to the occasion. Our
            mission became to serve all EVMS faculty and
            staff to ensure they are knowledgeable and supported,
            so they can do the important work of
            education and community service.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">In short order, the Distance Education team
            produced “rapid online conversion” training
            materials for faculty members, and they made
            themselves available day and night to anyone
            and everyone who needed help.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“Many of our faculty members had to adopt a
            whole new mentality,” Dr. Cadieux says. “They’ve
            had to put in an awful lot of work.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Dr. Cadieux says EVMS was better prepared
            for the transition than many schools, thanks to
            the foresight of <a href="https://www.evms.edu/directory/profiles/c-donald-combs.php" target="_blank">C.
              Donald Combs, PhD,</a> Vice
            President and Dean of the School of Health
            Professions. With the EVMS physical campus at capacity for students, Dr. Combs has pushed
            the expansion of online programs and instructional
            technologies over the last 15 years.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“Dr. Combs built up the technology and support
            for Distance Education,” Dr. Cadieux says,
            “because it’s one of the few ways the school can
            keep growing.”</p>
          <h2>No rotations: What do we do now?</h2>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p"> When COVID‑19 struck in March, in-person
            classes weren’t the only aspect of education
            affected. Third-year medical students — pulled
            from clinical rotations for their safety — needed
            a way to keep learning for six more weeks.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Enter Carolyn Rutledge, PhD, Adjunct Professor
            of Family and Community Medicine at EVMS and
            Professor and Associate Chair of Nursing at Old
            Dominion University. A former full-time EVMS
            faculty member for 20-plus years, Dr. Rutledge
            also serves as co-director of ODU’s Center for
            Telehealth Innovation, Education & Research
            (C-TIER) and since 2010 has pioneered telehealth
            in Hampton Roads, collaborating with EVMS
            along the way.</p>

          of new medical and health
          professions to meet and
          socialize during orientation
          day. This year, COVID‑19 called
          for a drastically different
          approach where students
          came through individually to
          pick up masks, badging and
          other materials.</figcaption>

        <div class="feature__content__story">

          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Dr. Rutledge immediately called <a
              href="https://www.evms.edu/directory/profiles/a-brooke-hooper.php" target="_blank">Brooke
              Hooper, MD,</a> Associate Dean for Clinical Education
            at EVMS, who oversees the education of
            third- and four-year medical students.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“I pitched her the idea to run a two-week-long educational
            program for third-year students that would have
            them ready to move into clinical sites that provided telehealth,”
            Dr. Rutledge says. “I felt it was my duty to help.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Dr. Hooper was thrilled. Part of what third-year students
            learn, she says, is “to be flexible and deal with all the
            change that happens on a day-to-day basis. Our students
            are so resilient. I knew they would step up.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Dr. Rutledge and her C-TIER colleague, Tina Guston,
            DNP, RN, Adjunct Assistant Professor of Family and Community
            Medicine at EVMS, jumped into creating the virtual
            curriculum. Working long hours to stay a day or two ahead
            of each class session, they made telehealth training videos
            and organized the students into groups of 15.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Each group was assigned to work with a physician on
            the EVMS faculty to develop and present telehealth protocols
            and consent forms for a designated medical specialty —
            protocols and forms that have since been adopted by
            some EVMS Medical Group practices.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“I don’t think I’ve ever delivered a course that resulted in so many
            students
            sending me thank you notes,” Dr. Rutledge says.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Distance Education team member Amanda Burbage, PhD, is an Instructional
            Designer and Educator in the School of Health Professions. </p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“What’s unique about this story,” Dr. Burbage says, “is because EVMS has
            good
            communication and collegiality and such an authentic approach to education, we
            were able to go deep in the bench and leverage the clinical resources available to
            us. This is also an example of medical students on the front lines of preparation.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“Sometimes higher education is criticized for being out of touch with
            reality,”
            she says. “But this is an excellent example of our students and faculty being
            completely in touch with what’s going on at EVMS and in our community.”</p>

          <h2>Lessons learned: A more effective future</h2>

          <p class="feature__content__story__p">In August, EVMS launched the new academic year with a hybrid model for
            firstand second-year medical students and some Health Professions programs, says
            <a href="https://www.evms.edu/directory/profiles/ronald-w-flenner.php" target="_blank">Ronald Flenner,
              MD,</a> Vice Dean of Academic Affairs. </p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“Students are engaged online for all materials that can be delivered
            effectively
            online,” Dr. Flenner says. “Clinical skills, anatomy and ultrasound training are
            taught in person using the appropriate social distancing and PPE to ensure the
            safety of students, educators and standardized patients.” </p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">During the summer, third-year medical students resumed clinical
            rotations,
            incorporating strict COVID-19 safety protocols. </p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“We’ve been very responsive to the needs of our students and the
            concerns
            around COVID-19 without compromising the quality of their education,” Dr.
            Flenner says. “We’ve done a good job of delivering a high-quality experience while
            ensuring the safety of our learners and educators.” Throughout the process, he
            says, EVMS academic leaders have held virtual town halls for students to keep
            them informed and address their concerns.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">The school’s effective response to the pandemic, Dr. Flenner says,
            demonstrates
            that certain aspects of education can be streamlined and handled more efficiently.
            “Some face-to-face time may not be necessary. We’re dealing with a group of
            individuals who are quite adaptable and capable of learning independently.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">One remaining challenge affects fourth-year medical students around the
            nation.

            in their
            final year. </p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">EVMS graduates are known among residency directors nationwide for having
            exceptional clinical skills. Coming up with ways for fourth-year students to
            display those skills requires creative thinking. “We are more committed than ever
            to helping our fourth-years achieve their career goals,” Dr. Flenner adds. </p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Dr. Brooke Hooper says she was struck both by the innovation and
            teamwork
            that kept EVMS education up and running, as well as the grace that faculty, staff
            and students extended each other. </p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“Everyone immediately came together as a team,” she says. “Everyone was
            willing
            to take the time to do this. What a great place to work.”</p>
