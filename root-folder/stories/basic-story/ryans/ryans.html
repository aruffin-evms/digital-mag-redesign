          <p>The importance of encouraging creative, risk-taking science and the ways it
            can impact the region's health have not escaped Louis and Prudence Ryan.
            That’s why they’ve given more than $2 million to establish a research fund
            through the EVMS Deliver on the Promise campaign.</p>

        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p"><span class="basic-story__lead-in">THE RYAN TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH FUND</span></p>
          <p></p>> will
          stimulate interdisciplinary research among faculty
          with expertise in biomedical science, healthcare
          disparities/delivery science, and clinical disciplines
          to improve the models of care and patient outcomes,
          as well as to meet community health needs. EVMS
          faculty will be invited to seek funding for research
          projects, collaboration expenses and/or equipment or
          technology procurement to advance the institution’s
          research excellence.
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“Translational research is a crucial step in the
          development of new disease therapies from years
          of laboratory research,” says William Wasilenko, PhD,
          Vice Dean of Research. “The Ryan fund will have a
          significant impact on promoting and accelerating
          the development of translational research at EVMS
          with the potential of developing new treatments for
          illnesses in our community.”</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">The fund currently supports two major research
          fronts at EVMS: cancer and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
          <p>CANCER</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p"><b>Aurora Kerscher, PhD,</b> Associate Professor of
          Microbiology and Molecular Cell Biology (pictured
          above left), should have Phase 1 of her project ready
          to publish by year end. EVMS houses one of the
          nation’s largest urological biorepositories, allowing
          Dr. Kerscher’s lab to identify a subset of microRNAs
          closely associated with advanced forms of prostate
          cancer. Her group aims to translate their work into
          effective clinical tools for late-stage prostate cancer.
          The Ryan funding enables her lab to generate key
          data toward this goal and aids in securing external
          government funding.</p>
          <p>ALZHEIMER’S DISEASE</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p"><b>Woong-Ki Kim, PhD,</b> Associate Dean for Research
          Faculty Development and Professor of Microbiology
          and Molecular Cell Biology (pictured above right),
          is utilizing Ryan funding for his project. The study
          is a unique opportunity that will advance the devel‑
          opment of a neurodegeneration research program
          in the newly developed Center for Integrative
          Neuroscience and Inflammatory Disease at EVMS.
          The aim of the study is to identify disease-specific
          changes in the metabolic profile of human blood and
          cerebral spinal fluid in mild cognitive impairment
          and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

          reusable face shields. Over four days, about
          three dozen students made 400 face shields that were distributed at local hospitals and clinics.<br />

        <div class="basic-story__content__story">
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“We wanted to make sure healthcare workers had what they needed to
            treat
            COVID-19 patients,” says Alice Chae, MD Class of 2021. “We made a harder,
            plastic face shield that was reusable and then a softer, disposable version.”</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">They used sheets of foam cut into rectangles and pieces of elastic
            to make sure
            the shields had a good seal and felt comfortable.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Over four days, more than three dozen student volunteers worked in
            shifts to
            make 400 face shields, which were distributed throughout local hospitals and
            clinics.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“I’m really grateful for my fellow students who stepped up and
            volunteered their
            time to quickly construct these face shields to make sure we could get them to
            providers as soon as possible,” Ms. Chae says. “Their dedication and hard work
            made all of this possible.”</p>
