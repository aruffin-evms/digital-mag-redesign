            Oldfield, III, MD</a>, would
          sometimes stay up late reading, engrossed
          in his favorite book. But it was no James
          Bond thriller or Marvel comic that captivated the teen. </p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">It was a microbiology textbook. “I read it like a novel,”
          he recalls, a fact that would surprise no one who knows
          him today.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">As EVMS’ primary spokesperson about COVID‑19, Dr.
          Oldfield is a familiar face on local TV newscasts. It’s a role
          the infectious disease specialist has reprised often during
          his 27 years with EVMS. </p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“I believe our viewers do and should trust Dr. Oldfield,”
          says Stephanie Harris, Anchor and Reporter with WAVY-TV
          10 and WVBT-TV FOX43. “In my experience interviewing
          him over more than a decade, he has never steered me
          wrong. The information he has provided in the past has
          always been accurate, and I have every reason to believe
          that he continues to work with the same dedication and
          diligence as he studies new diseases such as COVID‑19.”</p>

        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">That same dedication led Dr. Oldfield to build the
          Infectious Diseases division of EVMS from the ground
          up. It also inspired the career achievement of which he
          is most proud: creating a system of care in southeastern Virginia for underinsured and uninsured HIV/AIDS
          patients. Thanks to his commitment, the eight clinics
          he set up around the region have received more than
          $20 million in grant funding, most of it from the Ryan
          White HIV/AIDS Program.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="basic-story__content__wrapper">
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">HIV/AIDS had barely emerged in 1981 when Dr.
          Oldfield launched his career as a Navy physician. He
          trained in the Navy’s first class of Infectious Disease fellows, and over his 22 years of active-duty service,
          he investigated infectious disease outbreaks in Egypt, Panama,
          Somalia and Sudan. He also served as specialty advisor in
          infectious diseases to the Surgeon General of the Navy.
          When he retired as a captain in 1993, he returned to his
          hometown and joined EVMS.</p>

          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">For the Oldfields, medicine is a family affair. Dr.
          Oldfield’s wife, Stephanie, is a nurse practitioner specializing in urology; their son, Edward IV, earned
          his medical degree at EVMS in 2014 and is a gastroenterology fellow at the University of Virginia; and their
          daughter-in-law, Charlene, also a 2014 EVMS graduate,
          is a dermatologist. </p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Six years ago, Dr. Oldfield decided to step down as
          Director of EVMS Infectious Diseases and reduce his
          hours to part time. But when COVID‑19 became a pandemic, he was back in the office seven days a week. He
          has conducted COVID‑19 trainings and made numerous
          presentations for EVMS and Sentara healthcare providers.
          Along with his work at EVMS, he also is Medical Director
          for the Infection Prevention High-Performance Team that
          serves all hospitals in the Sentara Healthcare system.</p>

      <div class="basic-story__content__wrapper">
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“I’ve always preferred the word ‘we’ rather than ‘I,’”
          Dr. Oldfield says. “It’s only with team effort that we can
          accomplish things. When it comes to COVID‑19, it’s teamwork. I’ve been very impressed with how EVMS has come
          together. I’m proud of the effort our school has made.”</p>

        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Kurt Williams, a long-time Anchor and Reporter for
          News 3 WTKR-TV, has interviewed Dr. Oldfield regularly
          about COVID‑19. </p>

        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“He genuinely cares about public health,” Mr. Williams
          says. “He knows how to break down complex issues, so
          they’re easy to comprehend. That’s why we consistently
          request his expertise. He is an extremely valuable resource
          for the Hampton Roads community and beyond.”</p>
