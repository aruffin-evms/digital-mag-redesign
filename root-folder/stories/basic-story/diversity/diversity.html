            FLOYD DIED AFTER BEING RESTRAINED BY FOUR MINNEAPOLIS POLICE OFFICERS WHO SUSPECTED THE BLACK MAN BOUGHT
            CIGARETTES WITH A COUNTERFEIT $20 BILL.</span>
          A few days later, in his detailed response
          to that horrific act, Richard V. Homan, MD,
          President and Provost of EVMS and Dean of
          the School of Medicine, wrote these words to
          the EVMS community:
        </p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“We cannot call ourselves ‘healers’ and fail
          to take the necessary actions to eradicate
          the cancerous spread of racism. We have an
          affirmative duty to respond to racist speech
          and actions we encounter in both our personal
          and professional lives. Silence and inaction lead
          only to more senseless death and brutality, to a
          society crippled by the sickness of intolerance,
          discrimination and violence.”</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Dr. Homan expressed similarly passionate
          sentiments following the 2019 disclosure of
          racist photos in a 1984 student yearbook. In
          overseeing an institution-wide response, he
          commissioned an independent Community
          Advisory Board for Diversity and Inclusion
          to review the culture of the school and make
          recommendations for continued improvement.
          In June, Dr. Homan announced that the board
          had completed its study. </p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Chaired by Gilbert Bland, President and
          CEO of the Urban League of Hampton Roads,
          the eight-member volunteer advisory board
          found a generally inclusive and supportive
          environment at the school. “Students strongly
          believe EVMS is a great place to attend medical
          school,” the reports states, “and that its com‑
          munity-oriented focus and increasing diversity
          in the student body distinguishes it from other
          medical schools. The positive sentiments by
          students should be highlighted to reinforce
          and strengthen the culture and the school’s
          reputation.”</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Yet the report did say, “Faculty and staff have
          relatively low levels of trust in leadership and
          confidence in the future of EVMS, and more
          needs to be done to address trust among nonwhite and female employees.”</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“This was not a surprise,” Dr. Homan says.
          “These are issues facing campuses across the country. This recommendation reaffirms our
          commitment to women and people of color in
          our workforce and our student body.”</p>
      
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Faculty, staff and students recognized the
            school’s diversity, equity and inclusion initia‑
            tives as improvements. But the report says they
            expect the school to do even more to recruit,
            enroll and support students from diverse back‑
            grounds; attract and retain faculty of color; and
            close the gap in positive experiences between
            whites and people of color and between men
            and women.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">The report also acknowledged that the
            2020-2024 EVMS Strategic Plan, “Advancing
            Health Equity and Inclusion for Community and
            Academic Impact,” is providing needed skills
            and training throughout the school and making
            diversity, equity and inclusion a greater man‑
            agement priority. The plan — developed in sum‑
            mer 2019 by more than 100 EVMS faculty, staff,
            residents and students — already addresses
            some of the report’s recommendations.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">EVMS has made steady progress in diversity,
            equity and inclusion since Dr. Homan became
            President in 2013 and hired Mekbib Gemeda,
            MA, as the school’s first Vice President of
            Diversity and Inclusion.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">For example, in August 2019, EVMS admit‑
            ted its most diverse class in its history. And in
            March 2019, EVMS received the Institutional
            Excellence Award from the National Association
            of Diversity Officers in Higher Education. The
            association presents the annual award to a
            single institution of higher education that has
            “demonstrated measurable progress in pro‑
            moting and sustaining innovative diversity
            efforts within its campus community.”</p>
            <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">But there is still work to be done, Dr. Homan
              says. “The hallmark of our school and our grad‑
              uates is a focus on bettering our communities —
              and confronting racism and other barriers to
              inclusion is a key component of healing our
              communities.” </p>
