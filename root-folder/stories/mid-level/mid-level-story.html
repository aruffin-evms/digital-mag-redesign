          <p class="mid-level-story__content__story__p">Street Health launched during the 2018-19 school year, led by Andy Abayan, now a third-year medical student. Under the supervision of a physician, students conduct health screenings for people experiencing homelessness, provide referrals for follow-ups and collect data for continuity of care.</p>
          <p class="mid-level-story__content__story__p">He was inspired by the three years he had volunteered with Doctors Without Walls in his hometown of Santa Barbara, California. The group holds clinics in parks to deliver healthcare to people living on the streets.</p>
          <p class="mid-level-story__content__story__p">“I had the most wonderful experience working with that population,” Mr. Abayan recalls. “We’re all one step away from being in their situation. A lot of them had one bad thing happen and they couldn’t get themselves out of it.”</p>
          <p class="mid-level-story__content__story__p">That experience, he says, not only fueled his desire practice emergency medicine, it inspired him to pitch the idea for Street Health to Don Robison, PhD, Director for Community-Engaged Learning. “We’re such a community-oriented school,” Mr. Abayan says. People experiencing homelessness “are part of our community.”</p>

          <p class="mid-level-story__content__story__p">Ms. Conteh became involved in Street Health because she wanted hands-on experience. Before medical school, she worked as a rehabilitation counselor for adults with mental health disorders, some of whom did not have homes. She says the clinics can treat people who would otherwise have to go to the emergency room and incur bills they can’t pay. “It’s a vulnerable population that falls through the cracks very easily,” she adds.</p>
          <p class="mid-level-story__content__story__p">Street Health holds a free clinic at Freemason Baptist Church on the fourth Saturday of the month. That coincides with a free community lunch the church provides. During the winter, Street Health partners with the Norfolk Emergency Shelter Team, or NEST, to hold free health clinics at NEST shelter sites. NEST is the City of Norfolk’s</p>

            <p class="mid-level-story__content__story__p">A large, round table was loaded with pain relievers, decongestants, antacids, vitamins, fungal creams, bandages and other supplies to share with patients as needed. Street Health students also were ready to hand out donated clothing and pass out watches to patients to help them get to follow-up appointments on time.</p>
            <p class="mid-level-story__content__story__p">A group from Wagner Macula & Retina Center conducted eye exams to assess potential problems, such as vision loss from diabetes. Alan Wagner, MD (Ophthalmology Residency ’86), founder of the practice, is well aware of the need for this care — he is an EVMS alumnus and member of the school’s Board of Visitors.</p>
            <p class="mid-level-story__content__story__p">On this day, 22 students helped conduct the clinic, supervised by a surgeon, a psychiatrist and Dr. Gavin Rogers. Dr. Rogers assisted with Street Health while he was a student. Now he’s back to offer guidance.</p>
            <p class="mid-level-story__content__story__p">Dr. Rogers says emergency rooms treat a lot of people experiencing homelessness because many don’t have health insurance or primary care physicians. And not trusting the healthcare system, many avoid seeking care until their conditions deteriorate.</p>

We see a little of everything.”</p>
            <p class="mid-level-story__content__story__p">Norine Kuhn, a Research Associate at the EVMS Strelitz Diabetes Center, volunteered her time at the clinic to train the students to screen patients for high cholesterol and diabetes.</p>

            <p class="mid-level-story__content__story__p">“Once you know your numbers, we can do something for you,” Ms. Kuhn says. “This is a way for us to be able to help people who basically cannot afford to go to see a doctor. We can provide information and refer them to outreach centers that can help them get the healthcare they need.”</p>
            <p class="mid-level-story__content__story__p">Diabetes, she says, is especially important to diagnose and control because it can affect all aspects of life, such as contributing to vision loss and heart and circulatory problems.</p>
            <p class="mid-level-story__content__story__p">Ms. Kuhn’s mother died from complications from diabetes, which inspired her passion for diabetes education. “I don’t want anyone to ever have to go through what I went through. If I can help this small group of people, then I’ve made a difference.”</p>
