          <p class="feature__content__story__p"><span class="feature__dropcap">E</span>arly in 2020, as the magnitude of
            the COVID-19 outbreak started to set
            in, <a href="https://www.evms.edu/directory/profiles/william-j-wasilenko.php" target="_blank">William
              Wasilenko, PhD,</a> Vice Dean for Research, began consulting
            with EVMS administrators, government agencies and research leaders
            at medical schools across the country. In early March, EVMS started to steadily
            reduce the amount of on-site research and the number of personnel conducting
            research.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">A month later, the “ramp down” was in full swing. Basic scientists shut
            down
            all but essential lab activities. Clinical researchers halted most patient trials.
            Those involved in community-based research and student learners paused their
            activities. Only research deemed critical was allowed to proceed under tight safety
            guidelines.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“We wanted to reduce the number of essential personnel in the facility,
            helping
            to ensure that we had a safe working environment for our researchers,” Dr.
            Wasilenko says. The process accommodated researchers who needed to be on-site
            to finish up experiments — some the effort of months of work — and to maintain
            vital research equipment.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">By June, the school was emerging from the slowdown and carefully
            restarting
            activities. </p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“In general, [the slowdown] went very smoothly,” Dr. Wasilenko says,
            “and it
            didn’t have any lingering, long-lasting effects on most research programs.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">One example: <a
              href="https://www.evms.edu/directory/profiles/francis-l-counselman.php" target="_blank">Frank Counselman,
              MD</a> (MD ’83, Emergency Medicine Residency
            ‘86), Professor and Chair of Emergency Medicine, stopped his department’s
            clinical research in early March and temporarily limited its work to chart reviews
            and similar activities that do not involve patient contact.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“Since we assume every patient in the emergency department (ED) could
            have
            COVID-19 — regardless of their reason for presenting to the ED — we did not
            want to risk the health of our research nurses and coordinators,” he says, “or
            accidently expose a patient to an asymptomatic, infected researcher.”</p>
          <h2>Some challenges mean slowing down or starting over</h2>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p"> Unfortunately, the school didn’t escape unscathed.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p"><a href="https://www.evms.edu/directory/profiles/richard-a-britten.php"
              target="_blank">Richard Britten, PhD,</a> Professor of Radiation Oncology and Biophysics, suffered a
            significant impact to his NASA-funded work. His research focuses on identifying
            ways to protect astronauts from long-term exposure to space radiation. </p>

        Professor of Microbiology and
        Molecular Cell Biology, works in

        restrictions limit the number of
        staff who can work at the same
        time in the same lab.</figcaption>

      <div class="feature__content__wrapper">
        <div class="feature__content__story">

          <p class="feature__content__story__p">EVMS classified Dr. Britten’s research as essential, so he was able to
            continue his
            work when the pandemic began. But in April, NASA closed its Space Radiation
            Laboratory at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton, New York, where Dr.
            Britten conducted important aspects of his research</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Without access to that lab, Dr. Britten was forced to halt his work and
            release
            three EVMS lab assistants.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“Since [their positions] are grant funded, and it is illegal to use
            federal funds for
            them to work on other projects,” he says, “I had to lay them off.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">The research — part of a long-term project started in June 2019 — was
            “decimated.” He estimates the loss at $200,000.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“I have lost a year’s work and have to start over again,” Dr. Britten
            says. “I will
            rebuild. It’s just going to be hard.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Another basic scientist, <a
              href="https://www.evms.edu/directory/profiles/diane-m-duffy.php" target="_blank">Diane Duffy, PhD,</a>
            Professor of Physiological Sciences,
            lost two months of work researching ovulation. Though she is back in the lab
            now, work has slowed.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“Social distancing restricts the number of people we can have in the lab
            at any
            given time,” Dr. Duffy says. “This slows progress on experiments since we have to
            take turns working in the space.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">She also has found it difficult to find needed supplies and “reagents,”
            chemicals
            commonly used in scientific experiments. “Experiments can be held up for weeks
            because we need an item that is slow to arrive or on long-term back order.”</p>
          <h2>Some changes offer silver linings
          </h2>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">On the bright side, Dr. Duffy says, is the research community’s newfound
            reliance
            on videoconferencing. </p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“Everyone is meeting virtually,” she says. “I see distant colleagues
            more often
            because we can hold impromptu meetings using videoconferencing software.
            Major in-person meetings were cancelled and were replaced with smaller, more
            flexible virtual meetings. I hope the scientific community will continue to
            interact like this beyond COVID-19.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Among student researchers, the biggest impact was felt in the “summer
            scholars”
            student-research program.</p>

          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“We initially tried to conduct it in a remote fashion,” Dr. Wasilenko
            says, “but as
            the virus outbreak escalated and the general restrictions in various educational
            programs expanded, we had to cancel the traditional program.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">EVMS was able to salvage some aspects of the program. The school created
            an
            alternative research experience for medical students who often count on the
            research experience to help them vie for competitive residency slots.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">One EVMS researcher found opportunity in the pandemic.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Sunita Dodani, MD, PhD, Founding Director of the EVMS-Sentara Healthcare
            Analytics and Delivery Science Institute (HADSI), is leading a multi-institution
            effort to establish a nationwide COVID-19 registry focused on health disparities</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“The registry will provide state-level data to identify economic, racial
            and ethnic
            inequities associated with COVID-19,” Dr. Dodani says. “This comprehensive,
            longitudinal data — including race, ethnicity, socioeconomic, occupational and
            geographic factors — will be vital to teach us more about where the greatest risks
            of this pandemic lie and to guide policy solutions that can address disparities.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Throughout the pandemic, Dr. Wasilenko says he witnessed a “wonderful
            example” of people from all corners of the institution working together toward a
            common goal.</p>
          <figure class="feature__content__image-wrapper feature-content__image-wrapper--portrait">

            maintaining appropriate distance from her colleagues.</figcaption>

          <p class="feature__content__story__p"> “This really was a team effort,” he says. “There was tremendous
            cooperation
            to first ramp down and then to begin to ramp up research here at EVMS.
            That involved not just researchers and their staff but a range of supporting
            departments. They all had key roles, and I’m very thankful to all of them for their
            help.”</p>
