        <p class="basic-story__content__description">What happens when the
          people most affected by a
          policy aren’t involved in the
          process of developing it?
          That’s what the National
          Cancer Institute, part of the
          National Institutes of Health,
          expects Andrew Plunk, PhD,
          MPH, to determine — with
          the $3,073,371 NIH grant he
          was awarded in August.</p>
        <div class="basic-story__content__story">
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Dr. Plunk’s R37 Method to Extend Research in
            Time (MERIT) Award is titled “Using Differences
            in Perceived Legitimacy and Resident Compliance
            to Promote Fair and Effective Implementation of
            Smoke Free Housing.”</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">In February 2017, the U.S. Department of
            Housing and Urban Development mandated
            that all public housing in the nation be made
            smoke-free by July 31, 2018. However, the prior
            work of Dr. Plunk’s team suggests that public
            housing residents consider these policies unfair,
            which undermines compliance and potentially
            creates negative unintended consequences.
            The goal of the NIH grant is to verify how these
            policies can be harmful and propose adaptations
            to increase their effectiveness.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“Excluding people causes mistrust,
            which can have far-reaching ramifications,” says
            Dr. Plunk, Associate Professor of Pediatrics.
            “For example, we found that smokers who lived
            in buildings where smoking had been banned
            were less willing to quit and that their resentment
            about being told they couldn’t smoke in
            their apartments played a role in that.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“We think that perceived unfairness and
            mistrust could affect other important interactions
            that have implications for health,”
            he adds. “This is likely happening in other
            areas; for example, when people have a bad
            experience with their doctor.”</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Public housing communities in Chesapeake,
            Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth
            and Suffolk will be involved in the research.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">The MERIT Award provides longer-term support
            for promising researchers within the first
            decade of their careers. It is chosen by NIH staff
            from a pool of applications that received exceptional
            scores. MERIT awardees may obtain up
            to seven years of support in two periods: the
            initial five-year award and an extension of up
            to two additional years, based on an expedited
            review of the accomplishments during the initial
            funding period.</p>

          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Kelli England, PhD, the Toy Savage Endowed
            Professor in Pediatrics and Professor of
            Pediatrics, directs the Community Health and
            Research division of EVMS Pediatrics, home to
            Dr. Plunk and his research.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“Dr. Plunk and his team have worked
            in partnership with our public housing
            communities for many years,” Dr.
            England says, “to understand resident
            perceptions regarding equity and
            fairness and to implement programming
            that advances resident well-being.”
            This new grant, she explains,
            will enable him to propose and study
            beneficial adaptations to the smokefree
            housing policy.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">The MERIT award is the second
            highly competitive NIH grant Dr. Plunk
            has received.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“It is one of distinction that recognizes
            exceptional early-stage investigators,”
            Dr. England adds. “It is a
            well-deserved recognition for Dr. Plunk that
            underscores the value of this work in advancing
            the health of our community.”</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">EVMS co-investigators on the grant include
            Brynn Sheehan, PhD, Assistant Professor of
            Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences and team
            member with the EVMS-Sentara Healthcare
            Analytics and Delivery Science Institute; and
            Amy Paulson, MPH, Instructor of Pediatrics
            and Director of the Consortium for Infant and
            Child Health (CINCH) based at EVMS.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Ms. Paulson’s experience helping public
            housing communities become smoke-free
            dates back to 2010, when she started working
            with residents in Portsmouth. As a result,
            in 2015 Portsmouth public housing became
            the Virginia’s first smoke-free public housing
            community.</p>
