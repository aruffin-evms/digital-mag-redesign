              <p>What you need:</p>
              <p><span class="steps">STEP 1:</span> Use electrical tape to
                section off 3 inch sections on a
                cutting mat.</p>
              <p><span class="steps">STEP 2:</span> Cut the plastic into a
                strip 6” wide by 4” tall</p>
              <p><span class="steps">STEP 3:</span> Adhere the plastic
                covering to the elastic head
                band.</p>
              <p><span class="steps">STEP 4:</span> Staple plastic
                reinforcement to top of face

        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p"><span class="basic-story__lead-in">A</span> fter COVID-19 shut down
          college campuses across the country in
          March, including EVMS, that was the first question from a group of
          concerned students.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“Many of us were taken off our clinical rotations and had to leave the
          hospitals,”
          says Madison Seward, MD Class of 2021, “but we still wanted to make a
          contribution to help those on the front lines.”</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">It didn’t take long to find the answer.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">As COVID-19 began spreading, it quickly became apparent that there was
          a
          shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). Rising demand, panic buying
          and hoarding meant that PPE wasn’t available to everyone. The shortfall left
          doctors, nurses and other frontline workers unprepared to care for COVID-19
          patients, putting them at great risk.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Alfred Abuhamad, MD, Vice Dean for Clinical Affairs, saw the need and
          worked
          with Joseph Hudgens, MD, Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, to
          design two different types of face shields.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">It wasn’t hard to find students to help build them.</p>

          reusable face shields. Over four days, about
          three dozen students made 400 face shields that were distributed at local hospitals and clinics.<br />

        <div class="basic-story__content__story">
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“We wanted to make sure healthcare workers had what they needed to
            treat
            COVID-19 patients,” says Alice Chae, MD Class of 2021. “We made a harder,
            plastic face shield that was reusable and then a softer, disposable version.”</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">They used sheets of foam cut into rectangles and pieces of elastic
            to make sure
            the shields had a good seal and felt comfortable.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Over four days, more than three dozen student volunteers worked in
            shifts to
            make 400 face shields, which were distributed throughout local hospitals and
            clinics.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“I’m really grateful for my fellow students who stepped up and
            volunteered their
            time to quickly construct these face shields to make sure we could get them to
            providers as soon as possible,” Ms. Chae says. “Their dedication and hard work
            made all of this possible.”</p>

            <div class=bottomStory>
              <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">The mask shortage also inspired a group of firstyear
                medical students to get creative. Sarah Birk,
                Vivian Burton and Sam Stephenson, members of the
                MD Class of 2023, worked alongside a team of Old
                Dominion University engineers to prepare 3D-printed
                N95 masks for use at local hospitals.</p>
              <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“They are reusable and built like Legos,” Ms. Burton
                says. “You can take them apart, sanitize them, then
                replace the HEPA filter.”</p>
              <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">The students created several prototypes and asked
                local physicians to give their feedback.</p>
              <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">In all, they printed several hundred masks and
                delivered them to Sentara Norfolk General Hospital,
                Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters and
                ODU.</p>
              <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“As medical students, we really wanted to help,” Ms.
                Birk says. “Healthcare workers are doing all they
                can to protect us, and we wanted to do what we could to protect them.”</p>
