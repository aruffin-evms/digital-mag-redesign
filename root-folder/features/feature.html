          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Street Health launched during the 2018-19 school year, led by Andy Abayan, now a third-year medical student. Under the supervision of a physician, students conduct health screenings for people experiencing homelessness, provide referrals for follow-ups and collect data for continuity of care.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">He was inspired by the three years he had volunteered with Doctors Without Walls in his hometown of Santa Barbara, California. The group holds clinics in parks to deliver healthcare to people living on the streets.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“I had the most wonderful experience working with that population,” Mr. Abayan recalls. “We’re all one step away from being in their situation. A lot of them had one bad thing happen and they couldn’t get themselves out of it.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">That experience, he says, not only fueled his desire practice emergency medicine, it inspired him to pitch the idea for Street Health to Don Robison, PhD, Director for Community-Engaged Learning. “We’re such a community-oriented school,” Mr. Abayan says. People experiencing homelessness “are part of our community.”</p>

          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Ms. Conteh became involved in Street Health because she wanted hands-on experience. Before medical school, she worked as a rehabilitation counselor for adults with mental health disorders, some of whom did not have homes. She says the clinics can treat people who would otherwise have to go to the emergency room and incur bills they can’t pay. “It’s a vulnerable population that falls through the cracks very easily,” she adds.</p>
