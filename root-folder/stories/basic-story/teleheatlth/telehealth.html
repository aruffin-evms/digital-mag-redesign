        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p"><span class=" feature__dropcap four-lines">F</span>or two years, the EVMS
          Street Health team
          worked passionately to serve those experiencing homelessness in Hampton Roads.
          But as the COVID‑19 pandemic forced clinics to
          close, student volunteers were left searching for
          new ways to provide for their patients.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">The student-led <a
            href="https://www.evms.edu/education/resources/community-engaged_learning/hopes/">HOPES (Health Outreach
            Partnership of EVMS Students) Free Clinic</a> was
          facing a similar problem. As the only free clinic in
          Norfolk, HOPES provides patient-centered care
          to hundreds of uninsured residents in Hampton
          Roads. With clinic doors closed, its patients had
          nowhere to go.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">As both groups are <a
            href="https://www.evms.edu/education/resources/community-engaged_learning/">Community-Engaged
            Learning</a> initiatives and all learning had been
          moved online, student volunteers weren’t
          required to keep caring for patients. But the
          idea of walking away never crossed their minds.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">The HOPES team decided to transition to
          telehealth for their clinics. They began providing
          primary and mental-health care as early as
          March 19. </p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“We had our clinic coordinators reach out
          to all of our patients to offer phone and video
          appointments,” says Brianna Kelly, MD Class
          of 2022, and student Co-director of the clinic.
          “They were able to recognize any concerns and
          note those who required prescription refills.”</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">The solution wasn’t as easy for Street Health.
          “Our first thought was to try to provide care via telephone or video calls like HOPES,” says
          Katherine Schaffer, MD Class of 2022. “But we
          realized that it probably wouldn’t work because
          of our community’s limited access to phones and
          computers.”</p>

        <!-- [end] component: image with caption -->
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">With that in mind, student leaders decided
          to set up telehealth clinics at Freemason Baptist
          Church in downtown Norfolk. HOPES donated
          four laptops, and Street Health team members
          set up the computers ahead of the weekly clinics and left before patients arrived. Each week at
          least two doctors and two students would take
          calls and address myriad medical concerns from
          wound care to mental health.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“If someone required additional care, we
          are able to refer them to HOPES or one of our
          partners for additional follow-up care,” Ms.
          Schaffer says. </p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">While the solution helped the team stay connected to their patient
          community, it also came
          with a few challenges. “We don’t have any students or physicians there in person, so we have
          limited ability to complete exams and do labs,”
          Ms. Schaffer says. “These can really help us make diagnoses and determine the severity
          of our patients’ conditions.” </p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Despite the hardships, the transition has exceeded expectations. “The
          clinic has been wildly successful, and
          patients have expressed their gratitude for continuing health services
          in this season,” says <a href="https://www.evms.edu/directory/profiles/amanda-r-gibson.php">Amanda Gibson,
            MD,</a> Assistant Professor of Family and
          Community Medicine and HOPES
          Clinic Director. “Volunteer physicians
          have cared for patients remotely with
          various concerns, including depression, muscular injuries, substance use
          disorders and chest pain.”</p>

          Director of EVMS Infectious Diseases and reduce his
          hours to part time. But when COVID‑19 became a pandemic, he was back in the office seven days a week. He
          has conducted COVID‑19 trainings and made numerous
          presentations for EVMS and Sentara healthcare providers.
          Along with his work at EVMS, he also is Medical Director
          for the Infection Prevention High-Performance Team that
          serves all hospitals in the Sentara Healthcare system.</p>

          appointments, Dr. Gibson says Street Health
          volunteers went above and beyond to serve
          those in need. Hilde Franklin, MD Class of 2021,
          felt a responsibility to help and spearheaded a
          mask-making effort.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“I taught myself how to sew,” Ms. Franklin
          says, “which was a steep learning curve. But
          I finally got the hang of it and made around 120 masks." She also collected masks from the
          COVID‑19 Mask Force, fellow classmates and
          community groups to distribute to Street Health
          patients. </p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Mary Meehan and Andy Abayan, both of the
          MD Class of 2021, created care packages, which
          included hand sanitizer, soap, dental hygiene
          supplies and barrier contraception, to distribute to patients. </p>
