          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p"><span class="basic-story__dropcap">E</span>ddie Roebuck’s index and middle finger tap against the side of his leg and his wheelchair with intensity and intentionality. At first glance, this could be dismissed as nerves misfiring in a haphazard way, yet something begs for a second look.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">The beat his fingers tap out is steady, matching the slight bob of his head, and gets faster, louder as he breaks into song.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“Blinded by the light,” his voice bellows. “Revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night.”</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">The impromptu concert is disrupted by
            Eddie’s giggles and followed by a fit of coughs.
            The left side of his throat is numb today, and
            phantom tickles are getting the better of him.
            He drinks water to alleviate the itch, but the
            numbness makes it more likely he could drown
            from simply taking that swig.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">His legs are aching, too, and moving from the
            bed to the wheelchair and back hasn’t helped.
            Multiple sclerosis has taken a lot, but this is his
            new normal.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“I think my life’s theme song has changed, and
            now it’s Rocky,” he says. “Yeah, Rocky because it’s
            a fight some days to feel good and put on that
            smile, but it’s always worth the fight.”</p>

          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">MS is an unpredictable disease with a wide
            range of symptoms. Mr. Roebuck has primary
            progressive MS — the kind that packs a onetwo
            punch of steadily worsening neurologic
            functions without any chance of remission.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">For him, it has meant a steady descent into
            disability and a reliance on his mother, Gloria
            Roebuck, a slight, 77-year-old woman with a
            fighting weight of just 103 pounds.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">They do life together daily, sharing a house
            and the wild punches MS throws at them.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“You do what you have to do when it’s your
            child, whether they are 5 months, 5 years or
            54,” Gloria Roebuck says. “You do it for a loved
            one, for anyone really, because that’s what it
            means to be there for people, for each other. I
            know he would do the same for me.”</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">January 8, 2015, was a hard day.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Mr. Roebuck had been in the hospital for
            nearly a week. He thought the extreme fatigue
            and muscle aches wreaking havoc on his body
            were side effects of aging and the twice-a-day
            insulin shots he took as a Type 1 diabetic.</p>

        <div class="basic-story__content__story">
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">He was wrong. EVMS Internal Medicine
            physician Mark Flemmer, MBChB, diagnosed
            him with MS.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“I do my research, and I knew that if we were
            going to find out what was wrong with Eddie
            that we needed the best doctors and that meant
            going to EVMS,” Gloria Roebuck says. “I wasn’t
            prepared for them to say MS. It’s the one thing
            I hadn’t researched, and it’s a son-of-a-gun, but
            with Dr. Flemmer’s help, we are doing everything
            we can.”</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Many wouldn’t have taken the diagnosis
            well. But that’s just not Mr. Roebuck. He
            believes that laughing is more fun than wallowing
            and chooses to face the challenges MS
            deals him head on.</p>
            <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“You get up in the morning, you look in the
              mirror and you smile at yourself,” he says. “If
              you smile at yourself, it will cheer the rest of
              your day up. I swear, it works like a champ.”</p>
            <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Today Mr. Roebuck is a “regular” around the
              halls of EVMS. Between his appointments with
              Dr. Flemmer and his visits with EVMS diabetes
              expert Elias Siraj, MD, he makes a point of telling
              people how much his doctors mean to him.</p>
            <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“They are the smartest people I’ve ever met,”
              he says, “but it’s more than their degrees. It’s
              how they know MS and they know diabetes.
              They make sure I know that they see me, not
              just my disease.”</p>
            <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Once a drummer and a DJ who worked
              the hottest clubs on the East Coast and spun
              records at parties for celebrities like Mary Tyler
              Moore and Calvin Klein, Mr. Roebuck still has
              the contagious energy of an entertainer. There
              isn’t a karaoke challenge he won’t rise to, not
              a joke he won’t tell, not a battle of music trivia
              he won’t win.</p>
            <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“Music is a real healer — I don’t know if people
              realize that — and it can help you find your
              happy,” he says. “MS can take a lot from me, but
              it can’t take my happy.”</p>
            <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">He’s got plans for the future. Plans that he
              won’t let MS undermine.</p>
            <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“Not being able to walk has been the hardest
              thing for me to do,” he says, “but as soon
              as I can, I am going back to physical therapy.
              I’m going to walk again, and then — then I’m
              going to dance.”</p>
