        <div class="feature__content__story">
          <p class="feature__content__story__p"><span class="feature__dropcap">A</span>s most people stayed home to
            avoid COVID-19, many EVMS Medical
            Group employees came to work each day to fight the virus on the front
            lines. That fight required major changes to how they delivered healthcare</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“Responding to COVID-19 pushed the industry and our Medical Group to
            re-engineer everything about how we provide medical care,” says Kurt Stauder,
            DPA, MBA, Chief Executive Officer for EVMS Medical Group. “Changes that
            would normally take years to evolve had to happen in a matter of weeks.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">While those changes were coming fast, Dr. Stauder says, “Keeping our
            patients,
            providers, staff, students and their families safe was, and continues to be, our
            number one priority.” The Medical Group engaged with leaders in patient safety
            and quality, medical directors and department heads to quickly develop a strategy
            to prepare for the pandemic. </p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Their plan included implementing a robust telehealth program, creating
            new
            policies about personal protective equipment (PPE) for patients and providers and
            developing a drive-thru testing system. </p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“In the first two weeks of the pandemic, we launched a fully operational
            telehealth platform,” says <a href="https://www.evms.edu/directory/profiles/alfred-z-abuhamad.php"
              target="_blank">Alfred Abuhamad, MD,</a> Vice Dean for Clinical
            Affairs. “Each receptionist was trained on how to transition future in-person
            appointments to telehealth when possible. This allowed many of our at-risk
            patients to continue their care from home.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">It also gave staff the opportunity to screen patients for symptoms of
            COVID-19,
            provide access to those with chronic conditions and ensure those who required
            medication were able to get it.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“EVMS students also helped us prepare patients for the transition,” says
            <a href="https://www.evms.edu/directory/profiles/margaret-y-baumgarten.php" target="_blank">Margaret Baumgarten, MD,</a> Quality Officer for EVMS Medical Group. “Several
            dozen medical students volunteered to contact patients, register them in our
            FollowMyHealth portal and help set up their preferences for telehealth.”</p>
          <h2>No rotations: What do we do now?</h2>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p"> While telehealth was a change for patients, it also was a major shift
            for providers.
            Leaders held virtual training for staff and faculty on how to navigate the software,
            and they provided best practices for telehealth appointments. </p>

          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“It’s gone very well and we are excited to use what we’ve learned beyond
            the
            pandemic,” Dr. Abuhamad says. “It will help us reach patients who are unable to
            get out of their homes due to illness, post hospitalization.”</p>
          <h2>New protocols keep patients and employees safe</h2>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">As the pandemic spread around the world, it quickly became apparent that
            proper
            use of PPE could mean the difference between life and death. EVMS Medical
            Group again worked with leadership on how to safely manage patients and train
            staff, providers and residents in safety practices.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Their meetings led to several new protocols. First, patients would be
            required to
            wear masks when visiting the EVMS campus. Second, healthcare workers would
            be required to wear gloves, masks and eye protection when seeing patients. Third,
            all EVMS employees would be required to wear masks when on campus, even in
            non-clinical environments.</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“To assist with the transition, we held regular meetings with department
            leaders
            to review PPE requirements and current protocols,” Dr. Abuhamad says. “We also
            created videos with infectious disease experts on the proper way to wear PPE and
            importance of wearing it at all times.” </p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">With many new resident-doctors on staff, Graduate Medical Education also
            created a public service announcement targeting residents to ensure they were
            aware of each requirement. </p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">In addition to protecting patients through PPE, several measures were
            put
            into place to encourage social distancing in clinical settings, including health
            screenings for patients at building entrances, plexiglass barriers at reception areas
            and signage to advise visitors to stay at least six feet apart. </p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">To ensure cleanliness of facilities, Dr. Baumgarten says the number of
            housekeeping staff was expanded. “Crews were assigned to clean patient-care
            rooms and instruments after each patient visit, as well as common areas.” </p>

          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Dr. Stauder says the safety protocols have been effective. He
            congratulates
            the Medical Group team and proudly notes that as of July 29, the date of his
            interview, “We have not had a known transfer or contraction resulting in an
            exposure or cluster in our ambulatory practice.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">Despite the inherent dangers of their jobs, Dr. Stauder says the
            greatest exposure
            risk for Medical Group employees hasn’t been in the clinics but in the community.
            “It is important for our trained professionals to continue to mask, distance and
            use the same critical thinking that keeps them safer at work while at home and
            living our daily, but changed, lives.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">When someone in the Medical Group workforce does test positive, Human
            Resources, Operations and Occupational Health and the Quality and Safety
            Leadership team have a process in place to track reporting, testing, sequestration
            and eventually a return to work.</p>
          <h2>Drive-thru testing was top priority</h2>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">One of the most important strategies to minimize exposure for patients
            was the
            creation of a drive-thru testing facility for those with symptoms of the virus. </p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“It was one of the first things our leadership team put into place,” Dr.
            Abuhamad
            says. “Those who meet the requirements are evaluated, tested and then receive
            education about next steps until they receive their results.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">The drive-thru testing program was set up in a parking garage on campus
            and
            primarily staffed by the EVMS Quality Office with the help of physicians and staff
            from Family and Community Medicine and Internal Medicine. </p>

          <p class="feature__content__story__p">While obtaining timely test results has been challenging, leaders say
            the program
            has been successful. “We’ve had great communication with those who have been
            tested,” Dr. Baumgarten adds, “and we have been able to quickly trace and find
            potential exposures to protect staff and patients.”</p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“Proud does not begin to describe how we feel about the amazing teamwork
            each department within the Medical Group has displayed during this crisis,” Dr.
            Stauder says. </p>
          <p class="feature__content__story__p">“Many of our employees have put themselves in danger’s way and faced
            extreme
            adversity, but they have persevered. We will be a stronger institution thanks to
            their hard work.”</p>
