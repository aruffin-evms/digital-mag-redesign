        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p"><span class="basic-story__dropcap">O </span>n a normal day, Margaret Stowasser, MPA
          (MPA ’16), PA-C, spends hours in the oper‑
          ating room as a Surgical Physician Assistant.
          Her daily routine is hectic — she collaborates with
          physicians, develops plans of care, educates patients
          and works as first assistant in surgery. But 2020
          has been far from normal for most people, and Ms.
          Stowasser is no exception.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">In March, Ms. Stowasser left her home in
          Raleigh, North Carolina, to serve on the front lines
          of the COVID‑19 pandemic in the intensive care
          unit at Elmhurst Hospital in New York City, which
          was then the epicenter of the COVID‑19 crisis. Ms.
          Stowasser described the hospital as a “healthcare
          war zone” with an overwhelming number of
          patients in all corners of hospital hallways. </p>

      <figcaption class="basic-story__content__image-caption">Physician assistant Margaret Stowasser served on the front
        lines of the pandemic last spring when she treated patients
        in a New York City hospital.  <br />

      <div class="basic-story__content__wrapper">
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Ms. Stowasser found a community of support
          by connecting with other EVMS alumni working
          in the city. It was a comfort that helped
          her get through the hardships she faced
          in the hospital each day. Despite all the
          challenges the pandemic presented,
          Ms. Stowasser says her education
          and training at EVMS gave her the
          confidence she needed to provide quality
          care through it all.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“Arriving at Elmhurst on day one,
          I knew this would be a different
          type of medicine — one I was not
          accustomed to, but that I was prepared
          for,” Ms. Stowasser said during EVMS’
          2020 Commencement Ceremony.
          “My training at EVMS … instilled the
          flexibility and adaptation needed to be
          a successful provider. COVID‑19 put this
          all to the test.”</p>
