          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p"><span class="basic-story__dropcap orange">I</span>n late May, George Floyd died after being restrained by four Minneapolis Police Officers who suspected the black man bought cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill. 
            A few days later, in his detailed response
            to that horrific act, <a href="https://www.evms.edu/directory/profiles/richard-v-homan.php" target="_blank">Richard V. Homan, MD</a>,
            President and Provost of EVMS and Dean of
            the School of Medicine, wrote these words to
            the <span class="noWrap">EVMS community:</span>
          </p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“We cannot call ourselves ‘healers’ and fail
            to take the necessary actions to eradicate
            the cancerous spread of racism. We have an
            affirmative duty to respond to racist speech
            and actions we encounter in both our personal
            and professional lives. Silence and inaction lead
            only to more senseless death and brutality, to a
            society crippled by the sickness of intolerance,
            discrimination and violence.”</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Dr. Homan expressed similarly passionate
            sentiments following the 2019 disclosure of
            racist photos in a 1984 student yearbook. In
            overseeing an institution-wide response, he
            commissioned an independent <a href="https://www.evms.edu/about_evms/advancing_equity/cabdi_report/" target="_blank">Community
            Advisory Board for Diversity and Inclusion</a>
            to review the culture of the school and make
            recommendations for continued improvement.
            In June, Dr. Homan announced that the board
            had completed its study. </p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Chaired by Gilbert Bland, President and
            CEO of the Urban League of Hampton Roads,
            the eight-member volunteer advisory board
            found a generally inclusive and supportive
            environment at the school. “Students strongly
            believe EVMS is a great place to attend medical
            school,” the reports states, “and that its community-oriented focus and increasing diversity
            in the student body distinguishes it from other
            medical schools. The positive sentiments by
            students should be highlighted to reinforce
            and strengthen the culture and the school’s&nbsp;reputation.”</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Yet the report did say, “Faculty and staff have
            relatively low levels of trust in leadership and
            confidence in the future of EVMS, and more
            needs to be done to address trust among nonwhite and female employees.”</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“This was not a surprise,” Dr. Homan says.
            “These are issues facing campuses across the country. This recommendation reaffirms our
            commitment to women and people of color in
            our workforce and our student body.”</p>
        
            <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Faculty, staff and students recognized the
              school’s diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives as improvements. But the report says they
              expect the school to do even more to recruit,
              enroll and support students from diverse backgrounds; attract and retain faculty of color; and
              close the gap in positive experiences between
              whites and people of color and between men
              and women.</p>
            <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">The report also acknowledged that the
              <a href="https://www.evms.edu/about_evms/leadership/strategic_plan_advancing_health_equity_and_inclusion/" target="_blank">2020-2024 EVMS Strategic Plan</a>, “Advancing
              Health Equity and Inclusion for Community and
              Academic Impact,” is providing needed skills
              and training throughout the school and making
              diversity, equity and inclusion a greater management priority. The plan — developed in summer 2019 by more than 100 EVMS faculty, staff,
              residents and students — already addresses
              some of the <span class="noWrap">report’s recommendations.</span></p>
            <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">EVMS has made steady progress in diversity,
              equity and inclusion since Dr. Homan became
              President in 2013 and hired <a href="https://www.evms.edu/directory/profiles/mekbib-l-gemeda.php" target="_blank">Mekbib Gemeda,
              MA</a>, as the school’s first Vice President of
              <a href="https://www.evms.edu/about_evms/administrative_offices/diversity_and_inclusion/" target="_blank">Diversity and Inclusion</a>.</p>
            <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">For example, in August 2019, EVMS admitted its most diverse class in its history. And in
              March 2019, EVMS received the Institutional
              Excellence Award from the National Association
              of Diversity Officers in Higher Education. The
              association presents the annual award to a
              single institution of higher education that has
              “demonstrated measurable progress in promoting and sustaining innovative diversity
              efforts within its <span class="noWrap">campus community.”</span></p>
              <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">But there is still work to be done, Dr. Homan
                says. “The hallmark of our school and our graduates is a focus on bettering our communities —
                and confronting racism and other barriers to
                inclusion is a key component of healing our&nbsp;communities.” </p>
