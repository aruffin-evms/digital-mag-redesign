                    Margaret Stowasser, MPA
                    (MPA ’16), PA-C, spends hours in the operating room as a Surgical Physician Assistant.
                    Her daily routine is hectic — she collaborates with
                    physicians, develops plans of care, educates patients
                    and works as first assistant in surgery. But 2020
                    has been far from normal for most people, and Ms.
                    Stowasser is no exception.</p>
                <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">In March, Ms. Stowasser left her home in
                    Raleigh, North Carolina, to serve on the front lines
                    of the COVID‑19 pandemic in the intensive care
                    unit at Elmhurst Hospital in New York City, which
                    was then the epicenter of the COVID‑19 crisis. Ms.
                    Stowasser described the hospital as a “healthcare
                    war zone” with an overwhelming number of
                    patients in all corners of hospital hallways. </p>

                <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Ms. Stowasser found a community of support
                    by connecting with other EVMS alumni working
                    in the city. It was a comfort that helped
                    her get through the hardships she faced
                    in the hospital each day. Despite all the
                    challenges the pandemic presented,
                    Ms. Stowasser says her education
                    and training at EVMS gave her the
                    confidence she needed to provide quality
                    care through it all.</p>
                <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“Arriving at Elmhurst on day one,
                    I knew this would be a different
                    type of medicine — one I was not
                    accustomed to, but that I was prepared
                    for,” Ms. Stowasser said during EVMS’
                    2020 Commencement Ceremony.
                    “My training at EVMS … instilled the
                    flexibility and adaptation needed to be
                    a successful provider. COVID‑19 put this
                    all to the test.”</p>
