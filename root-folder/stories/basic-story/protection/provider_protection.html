          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p"><span class="basic-story__lead-in">A</span> fter COVID-19 shut down college campuses across the country in
            March, including EVMS, that was the first question from a group of
            concerned students.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“Many of us were taken off our clinical rotations and had to leave the hospitals,”
            says Madison Seward, MD Class of 2021, “but we still wanted to make a
            contribution to help those on the front lines.”</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">It didn’t take long to find the answer.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">As COVID-19 began spreading, it quickly became apparent that there was a
            shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE). Rising demand, panic buying
            and hoarding meant that PPE wasn’t available to everyone. The shortfall left
            doctors, nurses and other frontline workers unprepared to care for COVID-19
            patients, putting them at great risk.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Alfred Abuhamad, MD, Vice Dean for Clinical Affairs, saw the need and worked
            with Joseph Hudgens, MD, Associate Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology, to
            design two different types of face shields.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">It wasn’t hard to find students to help build them.</p>

          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“We wanted to make sure healthcare workers had what they needed to treat
            COVID-19 patients,” says Alice Chae, MD Class of 2021. “We made a harder,
            plastic face shield that was reusable and then a softer, disposable version.”</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">They used sheets of foam cut into rectangles and pieces of elastic to make sure
            the shields had a good seal and felt comfortable.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Over four days, more than three dozen student volunteers worked in shifts to
            make 400 face shields, which were distributed throughout local hospitals and
            clinics.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">“I’m really grateful for my fellow students who stepped up and volunteered their
          time to quickly construct these face shields to make sure we could get them to
          providers as soon as possible,” Ms. Chae says. “Their dedication and hard work
          made all of this possible.”</p>

          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Ms. Conteh became involved in Street Health because she wanted hands-on experience. Before medical school, she worked as a rehabilitation counselor for adults with mental health disorders, some of whom did not have homes. She says the clinics can treat people who would otherwise have to go to the emergency room and incur bills they can’t pay. “It’s a vulnerable population that falls through the cracks very easily,” she adds.</p>
          <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Street Health holds a free clinic at Freemason Baptist Church on the fourth Saturday of the month. That coincides with a free community lunch the church provides. During the winter, Street Health partners with the Norfolk Emergency Shelter Team, or NEST, to hold free health clinics at NEST shelter sites. NEST is the City of Norfolk’s</p>
