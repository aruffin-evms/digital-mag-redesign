          vulnerable patients and their loved ones navigate uncertainty. It’s what I
          know, and it gives meaning to my work in medicine both in the hospital
          and in the skilled and long-term care facilities.</p>

        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">But doing this well requires a team — more importantly, the patient’s team,
          which includes loved ones and caregivers, to ensure a truly person-centered
          connection and plan.  </p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">During the COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing and visiting restrictions
          have had heartbreaking consequences, especially for our nursing home residents.
          Despite being surrounded by staff and residents they may have known for years,
          older adults are missing a vital part of their care team: their loved ones. </p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Loved ones who may not have seen the patient for weeks or months due to
          visitor restrictions are now frequently being asked to make critical care decisions
          on the patient’s behalf. Patients — some never seriously ill before — now find
          themselves critically ill or with new or worsening medical problems. And they
          face these issues alone in the hospital without their loved ones. </p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">At times, the grief, guilt and even despair of patients, loved ones and other
          members of the team weigh heavily, especially when caring for those who are at
          or near &nbsp;end-of-life.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Through this crisis, several truths have become abundantly clear. Every day, I am
          grateful to experience the power of genuine, vulnerable human connection and
          to extend grace to one another. Many days, especially in the nursing home, I find
          that listening deeply and intentionally to amplify the voices of those in my care —
          above the chaos of the system in which they are entangled — is the intervention
          that is most therapeutic. </p>

        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">In both the hospital and in the nursing home, our teams have intentionally
          worked to ensure that patient preferences and wishes for care are documented
          through advance care planning, a process that is truly person-centered. A phone
          call to loved ones with an update and to bear witness to the fear, worry and hope
          invites the opportunity to talk honestly about the uncertainty that may come. It
          also allows us to review patient preferences in the event that medical decisions
          need to be made.</p>
        <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Buying time until they can be physically together again, routine communication
          has helped bridge the chasm that separates patients and their most valuable team
          members. A number of patients and families have expressed sincere gratitude for
          including them in these discussions. But I am the one humbled by their trust to
          help them navigate their journey through this crisis.</p>
