                <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">When considering the focus of this letter, it was
                    the first word that came to mind. And since last
                    March, it has been the final thought I have had
                    at the end of every&nbsp;day.</p>
                <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Gratitude for our faculty and staff, who have
                    gone above and beyond to keep EVMS operating
                    while keeping all of us&nbsp;safe. </p>

                <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Gratitude for our students and residents, adaptable
                    and flexible as they are, who are eager to learn
                    in new and creative&nbsp;ways.</p>
                <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Gratitude for our physicians and health professionals,
                    who never hesitate to put their own health
                    at risk in service to&nbsp;others.</p>
                <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">And most of all, gratitude for you and all of our
                    supporters, who are standing with us during these
                    unprecedented times, reminding us daily of our
                    calling, our&nbsp;mission.</p>
                <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Within these pages you will learn more about
                    why I am profoundly&nbsp;grateful. </p>

                <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Albert Einstein once said, “There are only two
                    ways to live your life. One is as though nothing
                    is a miracle. The other is as though everything is
                    a&nbsp;miracle.”</p>
                <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">The last six months are proof. We choose the&nbsp;miracles.</p>
                <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">From the bottom of my heart, I thank&nbsp;you.</p>
                <p class="basic-story__content__story__p">Sincerely,</p>
